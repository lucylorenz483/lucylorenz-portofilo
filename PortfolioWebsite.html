            <p style="color: #000000"> 
                Undergrad student at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a> majoring in <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/academic-programs/master-of-fine-arts-in-creative-writing.html"> Creative Writing</a> and <a href="https://www.vt.edu/academics/majors/professional-and-technical-writing.html"> Professional Technical Writing</a>. Considerable qualifications for editing, writing, analysis, communicating efficiently, and problem-solving in a dynamic environment.

                 Since a very young age I have loved literature. Reading has provided me an escape from the struggles I have had growing up. My love for books and reading has given me a multitude of experience in what good writing looks like and what excellent writing looks like. Because of this my ability in editing and revising others' works bring much joy and bliss to me. I love to help young writers be more comfortable in their writing and comprehension abilities. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have also submitted multiple of my poems, and short stories into many competitions throughout my days in college and high school. My writing style is inspired by uncanny imagery. I have been fascinated with phrases and meanings that can be either good or bad. I am also intrigued by the way something can feel good but also in other words unsettling at the same time, hence why a lot of my writing can seem uncanny sometimes.

                To prepare myself for a successful career in book publishing and editorial work, I have immersed myself in critical reading classes, historical literary classes, professional technical writing classes, and digital media writing classes.
                To apply the rhetorical knowledge I have gained while in school, as well as the practical knowledge, I have become a leader by taking on customer service and sales positions in smaller corporations. These positions taught me how to efficiently and respectfully communicate and persuade, not just on paper but also verbally to a team or individual. They have also helped me understand and recognize when leadership is lacking, and how to step up to fulfill that need for direction with confidence.
